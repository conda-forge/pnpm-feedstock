# pnpm uses pnpm as its package manager, which is kind of awkward to deal with sometimes

# as pnpm is quite a complex project there is one oddity we need to take care before we can do a
# `pnpm install` and generate our thirdPartyLicenses.txt file

# we need to remove two patches that get applied on top of two dependencies, as this breaks the `pnpm licenses list` command
# we also need to remove the whole `pnpm/artifacts/exe` folder as it contains one of these patched dependencies which leads
# to `pnpm install` failing (it tries to build vercel/pkg from source which requires yarn, yarn-install then fails as it detects
# that it is being run in a pnpm managed project)
# this isn't a problem license-wise as `pnpm/exe` (pnpm/artifacts/exe) is not part of the pnpm package but its own separate *thing*
